### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I put a focus on writing good scalable code. To do this I approached the challenge by using an MVVM architecture, separating the files into different folders based on the file types. I also encoraged testable code by using protocol-oriented programming, specifically on my Manager file. This way I was able to create easy mocks to use for unit tests and Previews. I spent a good amount of time on the UI as well to make sure to include all information for each recipe in an easy to follow way by separating the recipes by cuisine, and including the links associated with the recipe in a view after tapping on the item in the list.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent around four hours on the project. I chose to allocate my time to ensure good, testable, and scalable code. Also, a simple but easy to follow user interface.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I chose not to spend far too long making the UI look perfect since I wanted to approach the challenge in a way that will showcase my abilities to write bug free and scalable code. The trade off was beneficial to focus on performance, testability, readability, and scalability of my code, rather than a more complex user interface.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I would say perhaps the UI if looking at that specifically. I wouldn't want to ship this project looking the way it currently does. Specifically I think the spacing and elements on the RecipeView could be arranged to look nicer. I also think that the loading, initial, empty, and error states of the RecipeListView could be tweaked to be more appealing to look at.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I think it would be fun to even continue with this project by having more data for each recipe to be able to optionally display. And/or another network call for the specific recipe to be able to get more info. Possibly step by steps of the recipe, ingredients, descriptions, etc. I really enjoyed working on this project. I found it a good way to showcase my talents in a realistic way.
